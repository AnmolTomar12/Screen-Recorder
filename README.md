# How it Work :-
## After clicking on a compile or Run a code button the code run as screen recording is started for 10 sec and what is we are doing in the screen it record it in .avi or .mp4 file.

A screen recorder captures the activity on a computer screen and saves it as a video file. It works by capturing frames of the screen at a set frame rate, optionally recording audio, and encoding the collected data into a video format. Here's an overview of how a screen recorder works:

# Capturing the Screen
The screen recorder takes snapshots of the screen repeatedly to create frames of the video:

# Frame Rate: Determines how many frames (images) are captured per second. Common frame rates are 30 FPS or 60 FPS for smoother videos.
# Screen Area: Users can typically select the entire screen, a specific application window, or a custom region.
# Technologies Used:
On Windows: APIs like GDI, DirectX, or Windows Graphics Capture API.
On macOS: APIs like Quartz Display Services or AVFoundation.
On Linux: Libraries like Xlib or Wayland protocols.
Compression: Raw screen data is large, so screen recorders use codecs like H.264 or H.265 to compress video while retaining quality.
Encoding Formats: Popular formats include MP4, AVI, and MKV.
Libraries Used:
FFmpeg: A popular library for video encoding and decoding.
OpenCV: Often used for capturing frames and handling basic encoding.

# Writing the Video File
The encoded video is written to a file on the user's device. The recorder ensures synchronization between the video and audio tracks during this process.
